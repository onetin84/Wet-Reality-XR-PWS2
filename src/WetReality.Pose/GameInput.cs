// FuturLab.XR.XRInputBridge and XRInputManager. This build carries the code of
// the game's own VR edition. Section 55.
//
// A getter postfix rather than a setter call, deliberately. Writing a value and
// hoping it survives has already cost a full run: the game rewrites
// EquipmentAnchor.localPosition after MelonLoader's OnLateUpdate, which is why
// 0.23.0 had to move the position write one transform deeper. A getter patch
// cannot lose that race.

// bool __result keeps this clear of the struct-return family that hard crashed
// the process twice - sections 45 and 46.
